Local Representative     If you are in a direct marketing, consulting, advising, commission, service, non-profit job, this is a tool that you need to have in your kit for your clients, associates, friends and neighbors. It is an eleven month opportunity to earn as much or as little as you are interested in, simply by communicating with your friends and business associates along the coast of Florida.<sep>Brief Outline of Local Representative Position: Economic Recovery Group, LLC is a Florida law firm devoted to spreading the word to potential claimants about the new BP Horizon Settlement Program. Essentially everything you need to know about that is in the FAQ, will be covered in the one hour webinar training and will be emailed to you in a variety of updates. We are looking for businesses, nonprofits and independent contractors who can produce 60 months of P &amp; L statements, had a downturn in 2010, and in 2011 show an upturn. There are 63 other ways to make a determination, but the general claim will follow that pattern. There are a few excluded classes – bankers, insurers, BP Station owners, investment advisers, casinos and local governments are probably the most common. If you find somebody who might be interested, refer him to a regional representative who will encourage him to fill out the paperwork to evaluate whether he may have file a claim. A staff attorney from our Winter Park office will contact him, assist him in putting together his documentation and filing a claim if there is one. We are also looking for groups to present to, and any leads that come from those meetings will belong to the local representative. We have presentations that someone from ERG lines up and will invite the local representatives to be there and give claim forms to those interested. These will become yours as well. There are about 20 Billion dollars worth of claims walking around out there. This is the biggest settlement agreement ever filed. We have until April 22, 2014 to file claims or be barred. A rough estimate is that there are 800,000 potential claimants in Coastal Florida. There is no production requirement. This is just an opportunity that you can take as much or as little advantage of as you want. You will be signed up as an employee of Economic Recovery Group as the State Bar of Florida requires that you be an employee. We will furnish business cards and marketing materials. Let me know if you’re interested. Email me at #EMAIL_3f00b4e20c8bbab14a7c183dc3ab173b04ce72fcefe59c98b255f84561925ba4# or call me if this is something that might be of interest to you.

We like that!)Is your Instagram handle your @first name because you are THAT onto it?Do you have a gif for every occasion ready to roll as soon as you need it?Would you rather forget your pants than your smartphone?If you answered "yes" to any of those questions then you are invited to apply for the best job in the history of jobs everywhere, of all time. (Assuming you love social media. And Vend.)We have an awesome community around Vend, and every day we find more and more people want to talk with us on the platforms that they use naturally – their social networks. Which is why we need you. An über-talented Community Manager reporting to our Customer Marketing Manager Sim, to help engage and communicate with our 10,000+ retailers, partners, fans and friends!What you need to know:At Vend we are totally focused on our customers. Like, totally. This means loving our customers, building a product our customers love, and channeling all that love into full-fledged relationships. And, like any good relationship therapist can tell you, this means we have to be good listeners, open to criticism, honest all the time, and engaged. (Not engaged to be wed. That's taking things a little far.)So who will you be communicating with? Small business owners are at the heart of our community. Independent, entrepreneurial, passionate retailers from all over the world - who really care about what they do. Our community also extends to a global network of Vend partners &amp; resellers - accountants, small business consultants, hardware suppliers and a marketplace of add-ons, custom software developers, industry influencers and larger strategic partners, like Xero, PayPal and other really important people.We want someone with vision, creativity - and a little bit of crazy. We want our Community Manager to live and breathe social media but we also want you to be able to communicate beautifully away from your computer.

We want to show off our company culture and our enthusiasm for retail in a genuine and exciting way and more importantly we want our customers to feel listened to, no matter what they say to us.

You will be an advocate for our evangelists!We've put together a (humongous) list of what we want from our new Community Manager, but mostly it's around developing, maintaining, curating, writing and reporting on all of our social platforms. If you're a Community Manager already this stuff will go without saying.You will work across the whole business, you'll attend our Product and our Support stand ups every day, you'll be the ears and eyes on the social media ground and you'll be required to let the relevant people know if you hear anything that might be of interest.The below points are how we know the Community Manager is awesome. We're all about being awesome.When people are engaging with the content you post. They share it and follow us and start a conversation.Our customers (whether that's retailers, partners, add-ons, developers, or staff) all feel informed and up to date with what's happening at Vend.When all of our important communications are shared extensively and are made accessible, both internally and externally.People get in touch via every channel with every question imaginable and you respond to all of them. Even if you don’t know the answer, you find someone who does.Because of the nature of the role it's important to us that we can quite visibly see that you, as an individual, are all over social media. With that in mind we want you to incorporate social into your application. Given that you might not want the world to know you're applying for jobs we'd like you to do a couple of specific things.When applying, please do so using your Linkedin profile instead of uploading your CV.In the cover letter section give us some details of why you would be awesome for this role.

You'll be part of a small design team and have near complete creative control, working directly with the founders and the engineering team, to bring your visions into reality.You'll help shape the product, user experience, run in-person user testing sessions, and even dig into analytics to understand the impact of your decisions.

Essentially everything you need to know about that is in the FAQ, will be covered in the one hour webinar training and will be emailed to you in a variety of updates. We are looking for businesses, nonprofits and independent contractors who can produce 60 months of P &amp; L statements, had a downturn in 2010, and in 2011 show an upturn. There are 63 other ways to make a determination, but the general claim will follow that pattern.

A staff attorney from our Winter Park office will contact him, assist him in putting together his documentation and filing a claim if there is one. We are also looking for groups to present to, and any leads that come from those meetings will belong to the local representative.

These will become yours as well. There are about 20 Billion dollars worth of claims walking around out there. This is the biggest settlement agreement ever filed. We have until April 22, 2014 to file claims or be barred. A rough estimate is that there are 800,000 potential claimants in Coastal Florida. There is no production requirement. This is just an opportunity that you can take as much or as little advantage of as you want. You will be signed up as an employee of Economic Recovery Group as the State Bar of Florida requires that you be an employee. We will furnish business cards and marketing materials. Let me know if you’re interested. Email me at #EMAIL_3f00b4e20c8bbab14a7c183dc3ab173b04ce72fcefe59c98b255f84561925ba4# or call me if this is something that might be of interest to you.
