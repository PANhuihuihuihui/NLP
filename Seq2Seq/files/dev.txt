Office Manager Internet Administrative Judicata is looking for an Office Manager.I’m not referring to an administrator or office coordinator or even an executive assistant. Admins can work plug-&amp;-play in nearly any environment, helping a team or department with simple administrative tasks. Their skills are real, their role is necessary, and I’m sure many of them excel at their jobs.  And we don’t need one of them. An Office Manager, on the other hand, takes responsibility for facilitating all the operations of an office. They will be a central hub that is essential to our success. Their job, in effect, is to work often independently and in the background—identifying problems, considering all contributing factors, and executing effective solutions as quickly as possible.That may not seem like a huge distinction, but maybe it’s easier to illustrate the differences not in terms of what you do as an Office Manager, but what you gain from being one:As an Office Manager you will learn (and hopefully help form) the inner workings of a company. Startups around here are known for openness, transparency and flat hierarchies, but most employees will never actually engage with the organizational machinery that drives the success of the company. You will live in it. As an Office Manager, you join the Operations department, tasked with understanding the ways in which we work, supporting our colleagues when possible, and improving our work processes.As an Office Manager you will contribute directly to the creation of an incredible product. We’re tackling big problems here, and to achieve our ambitious goals we’ve recruited exceptional talent in engineering and law and have enlisted the support and guidance from some notable investors. The candidate we hire for this position will be a highly valued member of our small team; they will see the effects of their contributions in real-time; and they will feel crucial because we very much need them right now.As an Office Manager you can jumpstart your career. This seems like an unlikely path to success, but I speak from experience when I say that it is a lesser-known road. I cut my professional teeth as an Office Manager in the early days at Box, and the skills I gained there have propelled me in my career. Working in Operations, especially in the beginning stages of a startup, grants access to every area of the business—administration, finance, human resources, recruiting, business development, marketing and sales, support, organizational development, strategy, et cetera. For the right individual who is eager to work, learn, and grow in their career, immersing daily in this myriad of areas provides a rare experience and invaluable education in how to successfully run a business. As a former Office Manager, I have become an organizational jack-of-all-trades and have come to realize that there is significant value in knowing how to get things done in a variety of areas.It’s impossible to articulate just what all we need from you, but here is a general list of responsibilities that begins to scratch the surface:Oversee all daily aspects of office facilitiesWelcome and receive guestsManage lunch/dinner orderingManage all grocery ordering/shoppingManage all supply orderingHandle all postage and shipping (inbound and outbound)Oversee building management (e.g., repairs, cleaning, improvements, relocation, etc)Organize and maintain a clean and professional physical space in the officePlan and manage social life for the companye.g., Happy Hours, quarterly off-site events, holiday parties, etcManage company calendar onlineCoordinate guest visits, usability testing, etc.Support executive teamPlan, coordinate, and manage special projects; Possible examples include:RecruitingDesigning accounting processesFundraisingConference/event planningCommunity engagement (e.g., blog, social networking, etc)_______________________________________________________________________________________________________If you’re up for all of this, then we hope you apply below. In order to get to know you right away, we’d like you to answer a couple of questions in the cover letter you submit. First, in no more than seven sentences, please tell us why you’re interested in Judicata and what you might hope to be doing here after two years. Second, in no more than three sentences total, please discuss who your favorite villain is, who your least favorite hero is, and why.We look forward to hearing from you.Thanks,JaceDirector, Finance &amp; Operations<sep>Entry-level position; 0-2 years of experience (required)Bachelor’s degree from a top-tier university (required)Ability to thrive and execute in a fast-paced, demanding environmentDemonstrated organizational skillsClose attention to detailProven record of flexibility, resourcefulness, and creativityExcellent verbal and written communication skillsExceptional time management and self-motivationPositive team-centric attitudeAdvanced computer literacy – MS Office (especially Excel), Google Docs
