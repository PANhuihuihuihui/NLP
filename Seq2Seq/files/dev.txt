Local Representative     If you are in a direct marketing, consulting, advising, commission, service, non-profit job, this is a tool that you need to have in your kit for your clients, associates, friends and neighbors. It is an eleven month opportunity to earn as much or as little as you are interested in, simply by communicating with your friends and business associates along the coast of Florida.<sep>Brief Outline of Local Representative Position: Economic Recovery Group, LLC is a Florida law firm devoted to spreading the word to potential claimants about the new BP Horizon Settlement Program. Essentially everything you need to know about that is in the FAQ, will be covered in the one hour webinar training and will be emailed to you in a variety of updates. We are looking for businesses, nonprofits and independent contractors who can produce 60 months of P &amp; L statements, had a downturn in 2010, and in 2011 show an upturn. There are 63 other ways to make a determination, but the general claim will follow that pattern. There are a few excluded classes – bankers, insurers, BP Station owners, investment advisers, casinos and local governments are probably the most common. If you find somebody who might be interested, refer him to a regional representative who will encourage him to fill out the paperwork to evaluate whether he may have file a claim. A staff attorney from our Winter Park office will contact him, assist him in putting together his documentation and filing a claim if there is one. We are also looking for groups to present to, and any leads that come from those meetings will belong to the local representative. We have presentations that someone from ERG lines up and will invite the local representatives to be there and give claim forms to those interested. These will become yours as well. There are about 20 Billion dollars worth of claims walking around out there. This is the biggest settlement agreement ever filed. We have until April 22, 2014 to file claims or be barred. A rough estimate is that there are 800,000 potential claimants in Coastal Florida. There is no production requirement. This is just an opportunity that you can take as much or as little advantage of as you want. You will be signed up as an employee of Economic Recovery Group as the State Bar of Florida requires that you be an employee. We will furnish business cards and marketing materials. Let me know if you’re interested. Email me at #EMAIL_3f00b4e20c8bbab14a7c183dc3ab173b04ce72fcefe59c98b255f84561925ba4# or call me if this is something that might be of interest to you.

Operations Manager Information Technology and Services Information Technology If you’ve been keeping tabs on Vend you’ll know we’ve been growing a LOT lately. In the last 18 months you would have seen that we have been growing the Vend Rocket Ship at light speed and so recently we hired a Chief Operations Officer also known as the Chief of Getting Shit Done.Now; while lots of shit sure did get done. We decided to make things a little more intense, complex and lots more fun by doubling in size again. This means that we now need a team of people to help get MORE shit done globally.  We have tried doubling and now might triple in size next year for something different.The role of the Operations Manager is obviously another new role at Vend, spurred by what one can only describe as a humongous load of growth in 2014 and a humongous load more growth to come in 2015. We need someone to help scale the rocket, add extra tanks and fins and stuff to make sure we are on course and getting there fast.No two days in this role will be the same as you weave your way around facilities management of our offices globally and ensuring all our offices are fed and watered to allow them to keep the rocket ship moving.One day you may be negotiating with a lawyer in Toronto and then next you will be taking the lead role of operational projects ensuring that we are forward thinking in all our projects globally.We would love it if you have honed your kick ass operational tool kit in both large corporates and smaller agile businesses as we want you to think strategically, though move at Vend speed.If you don’t know already Vend is an award-winning web based SaaS point of sale for retail.  We’re chucking out crusty old cash registers and replacing them with iPads, touch screens and beautiful software.  We’re shaking things up and pushing out innovations, therefore finding - and meeting a huge demand for our services all over the world.
