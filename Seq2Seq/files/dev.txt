We're using technology to allow people to send money abroad without incurring punitive bank fees - and it has really taken off.Three years ago, TransferWise was just something that Taavet and Kristo built to fix a problem they faced when they first became expats in London.

Inside Sales Transportation/Trucking/Railroad Sales Legion Logistics, LLC is a service-disabled veteran owned third-party logistics company. What does that mean in plain English? First, one of our owners was injured while serving in the US Army (and we thank him for his service). Second, we work with companies around the country helping them move their freight. We don't own the freight and we don't own the trucks - we just connect the two. Right now, the Legion is expanding rapidly (and not just because we like to have pastries at meetings) and we need good salespeople to help keep our momentum going. Our sales floor has a fun, high-energy, collaborative atmosphere. As you might have guessed, we don't take ourselves too seriously, but we do make serious money. Income potential at the Legion is unlimited, just like the free coffee.  What You Can Expect From UsTraining. Unlike many sales companies, we don’t expect you to come in knowing it all.We have awesome benefits.  Medical, dental, and vision insurance are available to all full-time employees and the Legion pays 60% of all premiums.  Every employee has a $15,000 paid life insurance policy, compliments of the Legion, with the option to purchase additional coverage.After one year, you are eligible for our profit-sharing plan, because no one wants to work forever.This job is hard, and we know everyone needs a break, so we offer 10 paid vacation days and 5 sick days per year, and paid time off for bereavement, maternity/paternity leave, and short-term disability.We are co-owned by a service-disabled veteran, and we hold our current service members and veterans in the highest regard. If you are a veteran, you are in the right place.We do not have a typical selling environment. Our brokers call themselves “cooperatively competitive” because we offer team bonuses and we hang out at internal and external events together.Unlike huge brokerages with thousands of employees, our customer base is wide open. And a largely untapped customer base means unlimited income potential.Oh, you were expecting some type of compensation? After their training is completed, Problem Solvers choose between a commission-based or base-plus-bonus compensation plan. <sep>What We Expect From YouThis is an INSIDE sales position. You spend all day on the phone, contacting customers and trucking companies, working to move freight and dealing with issues. You generate your own leads.This position requires COLD CALLING. You can’t be afraid to pick up the phone and talk to strangers all day long. You need an excellent phone manner and a clear, pleasant phone voice.Our customers are our everything, and we expect them to become your everything too.During your training period, you work 7:30 – 4:30. After training is complete, you come in at 7:30 and stay until the work is done. There are some night and weekend hours.Our most successful Problem Solvers are entrepreneurial, dedicated, persistent, focused, positive and relentless. You cannot coast in this position.While we prefer college graduates, those who managed to survive high school and have some relevant work experience are certainly welcome.If you are a military veteran, we want to talk to you. We not only want to say thanks, but we also want to help you find your new civilian career, whether it’s with us or someone else.You will have to pass a criminal background check, credit check, and drug screening, but we know that won’t be a problem for you!

We believe exceptionally innovative technology not only enhances the way we do things—it redefines the way we live our lives. To us, iOS and Android are more than sophisticated mobile operating systems—they are game-changing platforms uniting information, instant access and unlimited range to create entertainment and enterprise solutions.We are a rapidly growing mobile strategy, design and development company at the forefront of the app revolution. We literally started the morning after Steve Jobs’ keynote announcing the iPhone SDK and months before the Apple App Store was even launched. In that time we have grown to a team of over 180 smart, passionate, hard-working Rocketeers and released over 150 high-profile, premium brand-critical mobile experiences for companies like History Channel, American Express, Discovery, ESPN, LEGO, Food Network, WWE, PBS, National Geographic, Coke, NBC Universal, NPR, Chick-fil-A and Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts, as well extremely popular games such as Rockpocalypse and Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage.

If you visit our studio the first thing you’ll feel is passion. The next is energy and excitement.

Bottle Rocket consistently does what other companies can’t. But this is only possible because of our passion. We know and love the iPhone, iPad and Android unlike anyone else. We’re those people who stood in line for the newest model. We value aesthetics, UI and UEX. We build awesome applications that serve the user and not only exceed standards, but set new ones.

And what if you’re referred from one doctor to another and they need to access your old records?
