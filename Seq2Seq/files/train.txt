Head of Marketing Financial Services Marketing CommonBond is building a new kind of value-driven financial services company.We are beginning our mission by tackling the broken student lending market, and changing the way people think about student loans with lower borrowing costs, a state-of-the art technology platform, and high touch customer advocacy.We are backed by by great investors, have a killer team, and are growing exponentially.More info on recent growth here: #URL_724362e31e8b9c5b4d975d5c95e080c2454b4580fe904efe6501a07862bf7c5f#We’re looking for a marketing leader to help us build a world class brand and accelerate our user acquisitions. A little about you: You’ve run a marketing team or organization before and you know what it takes to be successful. You’ve led a team and had P&amp;L responsibility. You’ve either started from zero and built a sustainable business or taken a successful product or brand and made it truly special. You can operate across multiple marketing channels and with scarce resources. You know how to build a team and you get the best out of people. You might be an artist at heart, or a surgeon; ideally both. You have a history of success because you simply find a way to make things happen. You have a bias for immediate action and an uncanny instinct for channeling it effectively. Tomorrow is too late; yesterday is always on time. You’re good at what you do, and you know it because the results are on your side. But you’re also humble, and you’re looking to focus your talents on something you believe in. A little about us: CommonBond lowers the cost of higher education in the U.S. The platform connects student and graduate borrowers with individual and institutional investors to save borrowers money on their student loans and allow investors to earn a financial return. CommonBond is a fast-paced, exciting environment where new opportunities emerge every day. The Head of Marketing will be an emerging hire on a growing team at an innovative company that is on the cusp of scale. You will be the reason the company scales. You are definitely invigorated, maybe a little anxious, and above all excited by that fact.You will build a brand. And you will drive customer acquisition growth.To do so, you will put a marketing budget to work implementing campaigns across several online and offline channels, including Email, Display, Social Media and Affiliate. You will lead marketing campaigns that drive step-function change. You will design and implement A/B tests and other analytical frameworks for your campaigns.But unlike any other marketing roles you’ve heard of, you will also use your smarts, and your proven entrepreneurial spirit, to make things happen. Your disdain for meetings and heavy bias towards action will move the company forward. You will go rogue because you have the wherewithal to act on proven instinct without anyone or anything getting in your way. Time is not your friend, urgency is your default, and action is your north star.You love our customers. You want to share our products with them because of how helpful they will be. You wake up every morning overwhelmed at the thought of ensuring enough people take advantage of what CommonBond has to offer. Feeling overwhelmed drives you, rather than paralyzes you.A few specific channels we imagine you implementing and growing include:Email marketing–including acquisition, conversion, and ongoing engagement.Paid search across Google &amp; BingPaid social - Facebook &amp; Twitter and other platforms where relevantDisplay - both programatic and premium where it makes senseContent syndication (LinkedIn) and amplification (Taboola, Outbrain)RetargetingPartnership marketing collateral across email, newsletters, web ads, etc.ContentDirect mail<sep>Experience running a successful marketing organization.Startup experience is a major plus.Demonstrated track record of increasing acquisition and executing successful campaigns.Analytical approach to marketing - make decisions on numbers and statistical significance of testsExperience building reports, analyzing campaign data, and quickly learning as we grow.Demonstrated ability to thrive in a fast paced, rapidly changing environment.Strong written/oral communication skills, with an ability to create order and flexible processes when needed.Entrepreneurial, responsible, self-motivated, upbeat team player.Creative thinker and resourceful problem solver.Eye for designBachelor’s degree.

PHP Developer Human Resources Engineering seeking a strong php developer who is uber up on 5.2 and can handle the following:Let me give you a few key elements  about our system, it should be enough for you to get a rough idea of the size and complexity of the project. We'll dig further into it if it's a project you think you can manage it. Ideally we're looking for someone able to deal with everything, but at this stage we can make it work if you're only interested in parts of the system. So we're talking here about a custom &amp; modular platform build in #URL_713ae5018654bda6aaadd80c5026bce93e23a993410fc105d10b71f594ca63d3#+ (started in 5.2 and tried to follow PHP releases).  It's a component or package based architecture, with core modules (login, users, access rights, display...) and multiple custom modules managed through a dependency manager. Everything is OOP and it includes a custom framework and DAL class for data management. It's linked to a mariaDB-galera database containing about 7Millions rows (a few gigabytes + 4gb of users documents). The database server is set up on a master-slave replication for now, but hopefully it should evolve to a full galera cluster soon for improved scalability.  Nothing exceptional about the database, except that it contains CJK data (mainly Japanese) which requires knowledge about character encoding and implies custom parsing tools &amp; special features for search and fulltext queries. All that is hosted in Amazon cloud: 3 virtual servers and a load-balancer.  Originally developed under CentOS 6, we've recently moved to RHEL7 (because of Amazon availabilities).  It requires decent Linux skills for networking, OS management, cronjob, backups and third party software management used by the application. That's the big picture of what we're dealing with. Please let me know if you're interesting in learning more about the software and its architecture.<sep>strong background in architecture and development with servers mixed in.

And Vend.)We have an awesome community around Vend, and every day we find more and more people want to talk with us on the platforms that they use naturally – their social networks. Which is why we need you. An über-talented Community Manager reporting to our Customer Marketing Manager Sim, to help engage and communicate with our 10,000+ retailers, partners, fans and friends!What you need to know:At Vend we are totally focused on our customers. Like, totally. This means loving our customers, building a product our customers love, and channeling all that love into full-fledged relationships. And, like any good relationship therapist can tell you, this means we have to be good listeners, open to criticism, honest all the time, and engaged. (Not engaged to be wed. That's taking things a little far.)So who will you be communicating with? Small business owners are at the heart of our community. Independent, entrepreneurial, passionate retailers from all over the world - who really care about what they do. Our community also extends to a global network of Vend partners &amp; resellers - accountants, small business consultants, hardware suppliers and a marketplace of add-ons, custom software developers, industry influencers and larger strategic partners, like Xero, PayPal and other really important people.We want someone with vision, creativity - and a little bit of crazy. We want our Community Manager to live and breathe social media but we also want you to be able to communicate beautifully away from your computer.

If they have a bad experience and they tell us about it, we're not done until we've turned that around and our customer is stoked with us. You will be an advocate for our evangelists!We've put together a (humongous) list of what we want from our new Community Manager, but mostly it's around developing, maintaining, curating, writing and reporting on all of our social platforms. If you're a Community Manager already this stuff will go without saying.You will work across the whole business, you'll attend our Product and our Support stand ups every day, you'll be the ears and eyes on the social media ground and you'll be required to let the relevant people know if you hear anything that might be of interest.The below points are how we know the Community Manager is awesome. We're all about being awesome.When people are engaging with the content you post. They share it and follow us and start a conversation.Our customers (whether that's retailers, partners, add-ons, developers, or staff) all feel informed and up to date with what's happening at Vend.When all of our important communications are shared extensively and are made accessible, both internally and externally.People get in touch via every channel with every question imaginable and you respond to all of them. Even if you don’t know the answer, you find someone who does.Because of the nature of the role it's important to us that we can quite visibly see that you, as an individual, are all over social media. With that in mind we want you to incorporate social into your application. Given that you might not want the world to know you're applying for jobs we'd like you to do a couple of specific things.When applying, please do so using your Linkedin profile instead of uploading your CV.In the cover letter section give us some details of why you would be awesome for this role. Include information and links to communities that you have managed before.Remember, we're probably going to Google you, so make sure the content we find supports your application.<sep>At least 2 years of Social Media or Community ManagementGreat writing and communication skillsExperience developing &amp; growing awesome social communitiesFamiliarity with major social networks and tools, blogging platforms, and email marketing toolsAbility to work in a fast-moving global team doing a million different awesome thingsMad Photoshop or some sort of designy type skillsUnderstanding of HTML or a willingness to learn would be a major benefitGreat customer service and the ability to build awesome relationships internally &amp; externallyAn understanding of SaaS, POS technology and the retail industryExperience of using Zendesk, Hubspot, Sprout Social, Salesforce or other business tools

Inside Sales Transportation/Trucking/Railroad Sales Legion Logistics, LLC is a service-disabled veteran owned third-party logistics company. What does that mean in plain English? First, one of our owners was injured while serving in the US Army (and we thank him for his service). Second, we work with companies around the country helping them move their freight. We don't own the freight and we don't own the trucks - we just connect the two. Right now, the Legion is expanding rapidly (and not just because we like to have pastries at meetings) and we need good salespeople to help keep our momentum going. Our sales floor has a fun, high-energy, collaborative atmosphere. As you might have guessed, we don't take ourselves too seriously, but we do make serious money. Income potential at the Legion is unlimited, just like the free coffee.  What You Can Expect From UsTraining. Unlike many sales companies, we don’t expect you to come in knowing it all.We have awesome benefits.  Medical, dental, and vision insurance are available to all full-time employees and the Legion pays 60% of all premiums.  Every employee has a $15,000 paid life insurance policy, compliments of the Legion, with the option to purchase additional coverage.After one year, you are eligible for our profit-sharing plan, because no one wants to work forever.This job is hard, and we know everyone needs a break, so we offer 10 paid vacation days and 5 sick days per year, and paid time off for bereavement, maternity/paternity leave, and short-term disability.We are co-owned by a service-disabled veteran, and we hold our current service members and veterans in the highest regard. If you are a veteran, you are in the right place.We do not have a typical selling environment. Our brokers call themselves “cooperatively competitive” because we offer team bonuses and we hang out at internal and external events together.Unlike huge brokerages with thousands of employees, our customer base is wide open. And a largely untapped customer base means unlimited income potential.Oh, you were expecting some type of compensation? After their training is completed, Problem Solvers choose between a commission-based or base-plus-bonus compensation plan. <sep>What We Expect From YouThis is an INSIDE sales position. You spend all day on the phone, contacting customers and trucking companies, working to move freight and dealing with issues. You generate your own leads.This position requires COLD CALLING. You can’t be afraid to pick up the phone and talk to strangers all day long. You need an excellent phone manner and a clear, pleasant phone voice.Our customers are our everything, and we expect them to become your everything too.During your training period, you work 7:30 – 4:30. After training is complete, you come in at 7:30 and stay until the work is done. There are some night and weekend hours.Our most successful Problem Solvers are entrepreneurial, dedicated, persistent, focused, positive and relentless. You cannot coast in this position.While we prefer college graduates, those who managed to survive high school and have some relevant work experience are certainly welcome.If you are a military veteran, we want to talk to you. We not only want to say thanks, but we also want to help you find your new civilian career, whether it’s with us or someone else.You will have to pass a criminal background check, credit check, and drug screening, but we know that won’t be a problem for you!

Sales Development Representative Marketing and Advertising   A Unique Job With a Great Company Do you want an exciting job you love, working with other superstars? Are you excited by making a real difference for customers? Join us as our Sales Development Representative! We’re a unique and innovative marketing technology &amp; services company… And we’re growing! Our new Sales Development Representative position is a key role in our company, because you’ll be the first person our prospects speak to. You, and your efforts, will have a real impact on the company finding, partnering with, and retaining great customers.  What Do We Do? Our company has offers sophisticated “done for you” marketing technology and services to solo practitioner lawyers and boutique law firms. You see, all lawyers (and especially lawyers in small practices) have a problem – and that’s there are only so many hours in the day. And each hour they’re working on their client work, they’re not marketing their practice – which means fewer clients tomorrow. And if they’re spending time marketing their practice, they’re not doing the client work that makes them money. On top of that, they still have to keep running an office and handling all the administration that goes along with it. So they’re always juggling between “doing the work” and “getting the work” … which keeps their businesses stuck in a rut. BUT – if they can break free of that tension, they can really grow their firms. How do they do that? That’s where our company comes in – handling their marketing for them. We’ve created a proprietary combination of technology, marketing creative, and business processes that allow lawyers to plug in to our systems very quickly, and stop worrying where their next client will come from. We take that a step further and provide it as a ‘done for you’ system so that our customers don’t need to manage our systems. We manage it for them, so they can get back to practicing law. Our customers are great people who are a pleasure to work with – and we become real partners to their business, helping them meet their goals by providing something they want and need. Our company is a profitable start-up, but it’s not like other Bay Area startups you might read about. We're small but we have a service with proven demand, great customers, and room for you to make a meaningful contribution both to our customers’ businesses and our team. We’re also not the sleep under your desk, constant chaos kind of place. We have a vision and a strategy for where we are going, and a clear path to get there. We’re looking for someone who is motivated by our vision, and by helping our customers succeed.  What Will You Do? As a Sales Development Representative, you will review in-bound requests for information from prospective customers, and reach out to understand more about their businesses. You'll connect them with the resources they need. For prospects who are the right fit for our services, you'll connect them with our strategy team to see whether or not we can help them. If they're not the right fit for our services, you'll still help them by directing them to other resources. You see, this isn't just another "sales role". We are absolutely committed to adding value to every potential customer we interact with, whether or not we're the ones for them. And what that means is, this isn't the job for everyone-  This is the right job for you if you: ... Truly want to help customers find the right solution to better their lives and their business ... Are unflappably excited and positive (even if a prospect doesn't want the help you're offering them) ... Like being given clear guidance on benchmarks to hit ... Are sharp as a tack - and like working with other superstars ... Take pride in going the extra mile ... Like pitching in for the team ... Are always looking to improve your craft - how to present better, how to position better, how to sell better ... Are looking for a workplace to call 'home' for the long termOur Process Is Different We offer an extraordinary opportunity with a top-notch team. We'd rather not hire, than hire the wrong person. Because of that our hiring process is different. This isn't going to be sending in a resume, and a series of resume-reading meetings. So, expect that this process will take longer... But as a result, you'll know this is the place for you. We're in it for the long haul, and want the right people on the team.This position is full-time in our offices in downtown San Francisco. No telecommuting or working at home. <sep>1-3 years applicable work experienceA self-starter with a track record of successful, credible lead follow-up and sales developmentPre-call planningOpportunity qualificationCall structure and controlProven track record achieving measurable inside sales goals in an environment where accurate entry and management of lead data in a CRM system was requiredExcellent listening skillsExcellent writing skillsThe highest level of integrity and ethics4-year College degree required

Full Stack Developer Internet Engineering We're looking for an experienced full stack engineer to come and join our team in London and play a big part in building one of our flagship products, Hire my Friend. Our ideal candidate has 3+ years hands-on experience shipping useful web products.Hire my Friend is a digital headhunting service with a big mission - to fundamentally transform the way the recruiting and HR industry works in favour of candidates. We put our users in complete control of who can see their data and we carefully vet companies that use our service. We then use technology to replace the worst aspect of the existing recruitment stack - the recruiter. We have over 15,000 candidates using our service today and thousands of companies that have requested access.We’ve recently rebuilt the entire product from the ground up and started generating our first income from companies. We are about to rebrand and relaunch with a new name, so you’ll be joining at an exciting time for the product with a clean new codebase and an ambitious growth roadmap. We’re currently self funded, but expect to raise money in 2015 to achieve our growth targets.This job is for you if you are passionate about using technology to help other people in our industry build great teams. It should be an opportunity to push your own development skills forward and make a big difference to a disruptive new product. Makeshift already has has a staff of 10 (75% technical) so you’ll be working alongside talented creative product designers and engineers from day one.From a technical perspective, we want someone who has demonstrable experience of rapidly evaluating and learning new technologies. Fitting our current stack come second to fitting our culture of innovation. Having said that, it will really help if you can write Ruby code to a high standard, good knowledge of Rails and have experience working with technologies like elasticsearch. A knowledge of front end engineering practices is also important as this is a full stack position, but you don’t need to be a designer.From a process perspective we’d expect you to have broad experience of a range of development techniques, and be confident introducing new ones to less experienced colleagues. At Makeshift we use a hybrid approach, built on a foundation of agile and lean methodologies. We try and pair program as much as possible, and we give engineers lots of freedom to solve problems themselves. This role will require you to be in our London studio regularly, but part time remote work is definitely possible.From a commercial perspective we’d love it if you have experience working on marketplace businesses that match people together, for example dating tech. We don’t expect you to have experience in the recruitment sector because, frankly, the more we learn about this space, the more we think the answers lie outside the industry. This role won’t be directly customer facing, but an empathy with customers hiring in tech companies, and candidates trying to dodge recruiter bullets will help you do your job better, faster.<sep>Must haves:Excellent full stack programming skills (RoR, HTML, CSS, JS) and ability to learn new languages quicklyHappy in a very flexible work environmentNice to have:An interest in product and UXMarketplace tech / dating tech experience
