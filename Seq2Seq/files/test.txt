Local Representative     If you are in a direct marketing, consulting, advising, commission, service, non-profit job, this is a tool that you need to have in your kit for your clients, associates, friends and neighbors. It is an eleven month opportunity to earn as much or as little as you are interested in, simply by communicating with your friends and business associates along the coast of Florida.<sep>Brief Outline of Local Representative Position: Economic Recovery Group, LLC is a Florida law firm devoted to spreading the word to potential claimants about the new BP Horizon Settlement Program. Essentially everything you need to know about that is in the FAQ, will be covered in the one hour webinar training and will be emailed to you in a variety of updates. We are looking for businesses, nonprofits and independent contractors who can produce 60 months of P &amp; L statements, had a downturn in 2010, and in 2011 show an upturn. There are 63 other ways to make a determination, but the general claim will follow that pattern. There are a few excluded classes – bankers, insurers, BP Station owners, investment advisers, casinos and local governments are probably the most common. If you find somebody who might be interested, refer him to a regional representative who will encourage him to fill out the paperwork to evaluate whether he may have file a claim. A staff attorney from our Winter Park office will contact him, assist him in putting together his documentation and filing a claim if there is one. We are also looking for groups to present to, and any leads that come from those meetings will belong to the local representative. We have presentations that someone from ERG lines up and will invite the local representatives to be there and give claim forms to those interested. These will become yours as well. There are about 20 Billion dollars worth of claims walking around out there. This is the biggest settlement agreement ever filed. We have until April 22, 2014 to file claims or be barred. A rough estimate is that there are 800,000 potential claimants in Coastal Florida. There is no production requirement. This is just an opportunity that you can take as much or as little advantage of as you want. You will be signed up as an employee of Economic Recovery Group as the State Bar of Florida requires that you be an employee. We will furnish business cards and marketing materials. Let me know if you’re interested. Email me at #EMAIL_3f00b4e20c8bbab14a7c183dc3ab173b04ce72fcefe59c98b255f84561925ba4# or call me if this is something that might be of interest to you.
